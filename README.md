<hr>

Git Commit Show is the leading online tech conference where senior engineers, researchers, scientists and professors meet while being at home.
A 2-day long, online meetup where carefully curated senior developers and researchers share their knowledge and breakthrough projects.
Unlike other online conferences, it is fully interactive with opportunities to connect with speakers and fellow attendees face to face.
Git Commit Show started in 2019 to provide a better alternative to physical conferences by being open, free and inclusive of people who come from remote locations and modest backgrounds.
